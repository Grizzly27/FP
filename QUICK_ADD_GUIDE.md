# Quick Add Feature Guide

## ✨ What's New in v1.3

### Liquid Glass Tab Toggle
The Tasks view now features a beautiful **liquid glass tab toggle** with two tabs:
- 📋 **All Tasks** - View and manage all your tasks
- ⚡ **Quick Add** - Batch create recurring tasks

### How to Use Quick Add

#### Step 1: Create a Recurring Task
First, you need at least one recurring task:
1. Go to **Tasks** tab
2. Click the **+** button
3. Fill in task details
4. Set **Recurrence** to Daily, Weekly, or Monthly
5. Save

#### Step 2: Navigate to Quick Add
1. In the **Tasks** view, click the **⚡ Quick Add** tab
2. The liquid glass slider will smoothly animate to the new tab

#### Step 3: Select Your Options
1. **Choose a recurring task** from the dropdown
2. **Set date range**:
   - From: Start date (defaults to today)
   - To: End date (defaults to 7 days from today)
3. **Select family members**: Check the boxes for who should do the task
4. **Preview**: See how many tasks will be created

#### Step 4: Create Tasks

   - Number of dates (based on recurrence pattern)
   - Number of selected members
   - Total tasks to be created
2. Click **⚡ Create Tasks**
3. All tasks are created instantly!

## 🎨 Liquid Glass Design

The tab toggle features:
- **Glassmorphism effect**: Frosted glass background with backdrop blur
- **Smooth animation**: Liquid slider transitions with bounce easing
- **Gradient highlight**: Blue gradient on active tab
- **Icon scaling**: Icons bounce when tabs are active
- **Inset shadows**: Multi-layered shadows for depth

## 📊 Recurrence Patterns

### Daily
- Creates a task for **every day** in the date range
- Example: From 2/12 to 2/19 = 8 tasks per member

### Weekly
- Creates a task for the **same day of week** as the original task
- Example: If original was Monday, creates tasks for all Mondays in range

### Monthly
- Creates a task for the **same day of month** as the original task
- Example: If original was the 15th, creates tasks for the 15th of each month

## 💡 Use Cases

### Daily Chores
- Task: "Dishes"
- Recurrence: Daily
- Quick Add: Assign to different family members for the next week

### Weekly Responsibilities
- Task: "Trash Day"
- Recurrence: Weekly (e.g., every Thursday)
- Quick Add: Assign to rotating family members for the next month

### Monthly Tasks
- Task: "Clean Garage"
- Recurrence: Monthly (e.g., 1st of month)
- Quick Add: Assign to all family members for the next 3 months

## 🎯 Tips

1. **Start with one recurring task** - Create the template first
2. **Use date range wisely** - Don't create too many tasks at once
3. **Check the preview** - Always verify before creating
4. **Mix and match members** - Select different members for different periods
5. **Individual instances** - Created tasks are individual (not recurring) so you can edit/delete them separately

## 🔄 Workflow Example

**Scenario**: You want to assign "Dishes" to Sarah and Mike for the next 2 weeks.

1. Create a "Dishes" task marked as Daily
2. Go to Quick Add tab
3. Select "Dishes (daily)" from dropdown
4. Set From: Today, To: 14 days from today
5. Check Sarah and Mike
6. Preview shows: 15 dates × 2 members = 30 tasks
7. Click Create Tasks
8. Done! 30 tasks created in seconds
